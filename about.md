## Resume

- Msc. student at Universidade de São Paulo - USP (2017 - **current**)
- Undergraduate in Software Engineering at Universidade de Brasília (2010 - 2017)
- Informatics Technician at Escola Técnica de Brasília (2008 - 2010)

## Technical Skills

#### - Software Engineer Developer

4+ years of experience with development of web
systems in multiple programming languages and frameworks. (Elixir + Phoenix,
Ruby + Rails, Python + Django)

#### - Data Science Enthusiast

Experience with development of unsupervised models for clustering problems.

- Worked in the Pushing Together project to create a model to identify groups of
opinion in a online conversation. The model was based on the k-means
algorithm and we used the silhouette score to discover the optimal number of
clusters k. The solution was then integrated to the clustering
module of the Pushing Together platform.

- Worked on a solution to visualize a large amount vehicle trajectories in the
traffic. To achieve a good visualization, a bundling algorithm was used to
group trajectories with similar characteristics. The bundling model was built
on top of Attributed-Driven Edge Bundling algorithm, which is based on the
MeanShift clustering algorithm.
