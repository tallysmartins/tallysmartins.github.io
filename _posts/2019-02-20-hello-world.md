Hi, dear future me. Greetings from the past! The readers should already know
that your name is Tallys and that you are a Software Engineer. By the time
that you were writing this you didn't know the purpose of this blog, have you
found it? Well, don't forget to say **Hello** and **Welcome** to your readers and be grateful
for their visits.

The only think that you knew for sure by that days was that the purpose of this
blog would change. Are you still using this as your personal diary? I guess you
still forget about almost everything, including your bus card, so you better
stick with it! I hope more people found your notes useful, that would be a
positive and motivational fact to keep you writing. 

Before you leave, let me remind you the reasons <u>why you've decided to create this blog</u>.

1. **Create Memories:** What if you die tomorrow? 
3. **Document your learnings:** That feeling of "I already did this, but I don't remember. Lets google it again."
3. **Improve your writing:** The more you write, the better you get.
2. **Improve your English:** Portuguese is so cool, but the world is ruled by English.


Well, now that we've met each other again, I will leave you here with some thoughts
about that Wednesday afternoon, where you were in your desk at the University
writing this blog and waiting for the Capoeira class, do you remember?

Thanks for your reading, dear future me. See you on our next post "How you spent
4 hours to setup your domain to point to Github pages".
